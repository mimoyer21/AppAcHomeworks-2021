# AppAcHomeworks-2021
These are projects from App Academy's "open" (free) curriculum: https://www.appacademy.io/course/app-academy-open.

Each directory is a separate project. Some are playable games (e.g. a fully working chess game, mancala, simon (simon says), tic tac toe vs. an AI opponent, etc. Others are simple homework exercises for practice.
